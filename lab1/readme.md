# Operating Systems Lab 1

This repository contains exercises that explore key concepts in process management, memory handling, and Unix-like utilities. Below is a description of each exercise:

## 1. Process and Memory Manipulation
In this exercise, we create two hierarchical processes (parent and child) that manipulate a 10-element array. This task explores the behavior of processes and how they manage memory, resulting in different values in the array after execution.

## 2. Custom Implementation of the `echo` Utility
The second exercise focuses on building a custom version of the Unix `echo` command. This implementation replicates the functionality of the original utility, including handling command-line arguments and options.

## 3. Custom Implementation of the `cat` Utility
In this task, we implement a custom version of the Unix `cat` command. The program reads files sequentially and outputs their contents to standard output, mimicking the behavior of the original `cat` utility.

## 4. Custom Shell Implementation
The final exercise involves developing a personalized shell capable of executing the programs created in the previous exercises. The shell should handle command execution, process management, and interaction with the user.
